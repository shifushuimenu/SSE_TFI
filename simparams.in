! ========================================================
! Simulation parameters for the program 'ssetfi'
! 
! SSE QMC simulation of the transverse-field Ising 
! model. 
! 
! =========================================================
! Explanation of parameters:
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
! J_1: J_1 \in {+1, 0} required
!   Nearest-neighbour Sz-Sz interaction. J_1 = +1 
!   corresponds to AFM interaction, which is treated via a 
!   plaquette SSE update. J_1 = 0 deactivates the plaquette 
!   update. 
! nx, ny:
!   Number of unit cells in x- and y-direction, respectively.
! n_sites: n_sites = nx*ny*nbasis
!   Total number of lattice sites. `nbasis` is the number of 
!   sites in the motif of the lattice, e.g. for the kagome
!   lattice set n_sites = nx*ny*3. 
! lattice_type = ["triangular", "kagome"]
!   Underlying lattice structure. For "triangular" and "kagome" lattices
!   the Biswas-Rakala-Damle plaquette update will be used.     
! ignore_Jmatrix: 
!   Whether the following input file should be used or not. 
! Jmatrix_file = "Jmatrix.txt":
!   Name of the file where the interaction matrix `Jmatrix(:,:)`
!   of shape (n_sites*n_basis, n_sites*n_basis) is stored. 
!   Jmatrix(i,j) specifies Sz-Sz interaction between lattice 
!   site i and j, which is treated via a bond-based SSE 
!   update. Jmatrix(i,j) > 0 corresponds to AFM interactions.
!   Plaquette-based update and bond-based update can be 
!   combined. In this case, the interactions given by
!   Jmatrix(:,:) and the nearest neighbour interaction given 
!   by J_1 add up. Long-range interactions should be specified
!   via the interaction matrix. 
! translat_invar: logical variable 
!   Whether the interaction matrix is translationally invariant 
!   or not.
! ignore_hz_fields: 
!   Whether the following input file should be used or not. 
! hz_fields_file = "hz_fields.txt":
!   Value of the longitudinal field for each site. Allowed values 
!   are [-\infty, +\infty]. Reading this file supersedes
!   the value for a homogeneous longitudinal field given in `hz`. 
! C_par_hyperparam: a tuneable hyperparameter \in [0, + \infty]
!   In the presence of a longitudinal field, not all clusters in the 
!   off-diagonal update can be flipped with probability 1/2 due to an 
!   exchange field. `C_par_hyperparam` > 0 allows to flip clusters even
!   for non-zero exchange field. 
! nmeas_step, Nbin :
!   In total, `nmeas_step` measurement steps are performed,
!   which are split into `Nbin` bins. 
! paramscan:
!   One of the string constants "parampoint", "paramscan_hx",
!   "paramscan_T", or "paramscan_hz".
!   For "parampoint", the MPI parallelization is over MCS 
!   steps for a single parameter point (hx, temp). 
!   For "paramscan_hx" or "paramscan_T", different MPI jobs
!   simulate different values of the transverse field `hx` 
!   or the temperature `temp` in equidistant steps 
!   between `scan_min` and `scan_max`.
! heavy_use: logical variable
!   Whether or not to compute the static structure factor 
!   for all momentum points and dynamical correlation functions. 
! deterministic: logical variable
!   If `deterministic` == T, the pseudo RNG is seeded with 
!   a fixed value and the MPI rank (good for debugging). 
!   If `deterministic` == F, the RNG is seeded from the 
!   system time (at the millisecond level) and from the MPI 
!   rank (for production runs).
