! ========================================================
! Simulation parameters for the program 'ssetfi'
! 
! SSE QMC simulation of the transverse-field Ising 
! model. 
! 
! =========================================================
! Explanation of parameters:
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
! J_1: J_1 \in {+1, 0} required
!   Nearest-neighbour Sz-Sz interaction. J_1 = +1 
!   corresponds to AFM interaction, which is treated via a 
!   plaquette SSE update. J_1 = 0 deactivates the plaquette 
!   update. 
! nx, ny:
!   Number of unit cells in x- and y-direction, respectively.
! n_sites: n_sites = nx*ny*nbasis
!   Total number of lattice sites. `nbasis` is the number of 
!   sites in the motif of the lattice, e.g. for the kagome
!   lattice set n_sites = nx*ny*3. 
! lattice_type = ["triangular", "kagome"]
!   Underlying lattice for which a plaquette update should 
!   be used.     
! Jmatrix_file = "Jmatrix.txt":
!   Name of the file where the interaction matrix `Jmatrix(:,:)`
!   of shape (n_sites*n_basis, n_sites*n_basis) is stored. 
!   Jmatrix(i,j) specifies Sz-Sz interaction between lattice 
!   site i and j, which is treated via a bond-based SSE 
!   update. Jmatrix(i,j) > 0 corresponds to AFM interactions.
!   Plaquette-based update and bond-based update can be 
!   combined. In this case, the interactions given by
!   Jmatrix(:,:) and the nearest neighbour interaction given 
!   by J_1 add up. Long-range interactions should be specified
!   via the interaction matrix. 
! nmeas_step, Nbin :
!   In total, `nmeas_step` measurement steps are performed,
!   which are split into `Nbin` bins. 
! paramscan:
!   One of the string constants "parampoint", "paramscan_hx"
!   "paramscan_T".
!   For "parampoint", the MPI parallelization is over MCS 
!   steps for a single parameter point (hx, temp). 
!   For "paramscan_hx" or "paramscan_T", different MPI jobs
!   simulate different values of the transverse field `hx` 
!   or the temperature `temp` in equidistant steps 
!   between `scan_min` and `scan_max`.
! deterministic: logical variable
!   If `deterministic` == T, the pseudo RNG is seeded with 
!   a fixed value and the MPI rank (good for debugging). 
!   If `deterministic` == F, the RNG is seeded from the 
!   system time (at the millisecond level) and from the MPI 
!   rank (for production runs).
