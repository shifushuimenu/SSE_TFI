1. Treat translationally invariant systems (with or without a nuit cell) 
   differently 
2. Crystallographic fast Fourier transform 
3. Clean up single-site cluster update (may be useful when other algorithms fail, e.g. for spin glasses).
4. Calculate autocorrelation times. 
5. Make sure all subroutines display their theoretically expected scaling of runtime 
   with input size.
