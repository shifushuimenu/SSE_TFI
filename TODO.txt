0. Clean up lattice structure (object oriented design ?) and use the triangular Bravais 
   lattice for constructing the kagome lattice. 
1. Treat translationally invariant systems (with or without a unit cell) 
   differently to reduce memory consumption. 
2. Crystallographic fast Fourier transform 
3. Clean up single-site cluster update (may be useful when other algorithms fail, e.g. for spin glasses).
4. Calculate autocorrelslation times. (DONE)
5. Make sure all subroutines display their theoretically expected scaling of runtime 
   with input size. 
6. Implement assert routine, pass an optional parameter to each routine to enable/disable the checks.  
7. Replace if clauses by boolean arithmetic as much as possible (in optype function and other 
   places in innermost loops)
